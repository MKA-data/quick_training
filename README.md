# quick_training
This reposity is made for a quick training I conducted for some friends. It contains two parts:

### Part 1: Getting Data from a URL & Extracting data from a PRT file (an output file from Eclipse Reservoir Simulation )
1. Get data from a **.zip** file from a URL, extract the contents (.txt and .csv files) and open them  and saave the .csv as .xlsx.
2. Input a **.PRT** file, get reservoir simulation outputs for each time-step and export the data as an Excel file.

### Part 2: Well-Logs Machine Learning (Lithology Classification)
1. Prepare well logs data (**.las** files) for machine learning (ML) training and validation
2. Set-up and conduct a ML study on well logs (for lithology classification and log synthesis)

The dataset for this part was curated from the Volve Field's well logs made available by Equinor.
