# quick_training

This reposity is made for a quick training I conducted for some friends on how to 

1. Prepare well logs data for machine learning (ML) training and validation
2. Set-up and conduct a ML study on well logs (for lithology classification and log synthesis)

The dataset was curated from the Volve Field's well logs made available by Equinor.
