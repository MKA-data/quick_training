## Part 2: Well-Logs Machine Learning (Lithology Classification)

1. Prepare well logs data (.las files) for machine learning (ML) training and validation
2. Set-up and conduct a ML study on well logs (for lithology classification and log synthesis)

The dataset for this part was curated from the Volve Field's well logs made available by Equinor.
